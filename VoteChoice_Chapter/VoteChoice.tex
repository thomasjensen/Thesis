\lettrine{T}{he} Food Flavoring directive adopted in 2008 was a controversial dossier. Especially Germany had issues surrounding the levels of allowed additives derived from aromatic spices and herbs. The dossier was adopted unanimously in the Council, but the German government attached the following statement to their vote. 

\begin{quote}
  ``Germany would have preferred a lower coumarin limit for traditional and seasonal bakery ware containing cinnamon the the one now provided for, but in a spirit of compromise can nevertheless support the proposed maximum level''
\flushright{ - Council Monthly Summaries October 2008 p. 21}
\end{quote}

 The dossier had been debated in the Council and parliament since 2006 and the parliament had significantly strengthened the scope of text from the Commission. Among other things, the Parliament proposed to leave an annex regarding the risk of using certain aromatic herbs and spices open until further evidence could be provided to determine the appropriate risk levels. This was welcomed by Germany which had argued that the levels set in the Commission proposal with regards to cinnamon were too high. However the Parliaments amendments was met with opposition from other governments in the Council, who feared that traditional artisans that produced bakery goods with cinnamon would be unnecessarily burdened by a lower limit.  Recognizing that the Council could not reach a decision the Commission withdrew the proposal, to redraft it. After several debates in the Council Germany agreed to give in on its reservations. 

The voting behavior of Germany on the Food Flavoring directive represents a case where  ....

This sort of behavior is an aspect of decision making not captured in current studies of the Council.  Most studies so far only examine yes votes, no votes or abstentions, thus situations like the one above where Germany expressed strong reservations about the legislation, but still voted yes, are not captured. Including cases like the one above thus allows us to study voting behavior in a more fine grained manner.

It is a commonly used explanation whenever a pattern of consensus is found in the Council to refer to the consensus norm, and often the high degree of unanimously adopted dossiers in the Council is used as corroborating evidence. However using unanimously adopted decisions as evidence for a consensus norm is not without pitfalls. There are many reasons for why a dossier was adopted unanimously. A dossier could be uncontroversial, thus requiring no need for seeking consensus. It is also possible that the preferences where so aligned that an agreement was reached without needing to resort to long negotiations. Finally it might be that logrolling was the mechanism. 

The cases of inflating a data set with uncontroversial dossiers or dossiers where the preferences were aligned can be remedied at the case selection stage. To distinguish between logrolling and diffuse reciprocity it is argued that behavior of the type exhibited by Germany above can be interpreted as engaging in diffuse reciprocity, by building up the ``favor bank''. 


\section{Diffuse Reciprocity and Voting in the Council}

Social norms offer consideral scope for interpretation, manipulation and choice. To treat norms as monolithic entities that determine social interactions is to revert back to the fallacy of the over-socialized actor that has plagued much of constructivist theory, however to treat norms purely n as tools to mask self-interest is to make the fallacy of the under-socialized actor plaguing much of rational choice theory \citetext{see \citealt{Elster1989} and \citealt{Schimmelfennig2000} for good overviews and critiques}. The theory of diffuse reciprocity is based around the notion of unanticipated consequences, as exchanges aquire a decidedly social flavor, actors get caught up in the emerging system of debts and credits. It is important to keep in mind that at no point are actors aiming towards such a system, it is an emergent phenomena resultant from the interactions in a social system. Since diffuse reciprocity do not rely on the internalization of a social norm, it is closer to a social equilibrium in which most actors would be worse of if they engaged in off equilibrium behavior. In such a system it is always a possibility that a government choose to pursue its own interest in hope of some short term gain, if the expected gain is higher than the expected long term loss in standing. The pertinent question raised here is when will a government decide to deviate from the exchange system, and pursue its own narrow interests. Drawing upon the work in chapter \ref{chapter:theory} we can label the incentives to defect in two categories, namely domestic concerns and preferences. These two categories are not entirely mutually exclusive, it is possible that domestic concerns will align with strong preferences against the final outcome. Furthermore the two categories are roughly correspondent to the classic concerns over whether politicians are mainly driven by the wish to succeed electorally, or to influence policies \citep{Strom1990}. There is evidence for both types of motivations in the literature on coalition formation, for instance \citet{MartinStevenson2001} show that parties, when deciding with whom to create a coalition, will show concerns for which office they will hold and the policy content of the coalition. In the Council concerns about electoral success can manifest themselves when domestic politics and EU legislation collide. This can often put governments in delicate situations where they must choose between being good members of the EU and appeasing domestic constituencies. The trouble of the reintroduction of the border control at the Danish border is illustrative in this regard. As part of a domestic settlement the Danish government agreed to introduce a limited border control in order to get the votes from the nationalistic Danish Peoples Party (DPP). Since Denmark is a member of the Schengen area, the implementation could only be very limited if should be complient with Schengen rules. However at home the DPP was claiming that the border controls would be a return to the border control that was in place befor Denmark joined the Schengen area \citep{Olsen2011,Euractiv2011}. This put the government in a difficult position where it had to choose between either downplaying the role of the border control, which would offend the DPP, or going along with the DPPs claim which would offend the Commission. 

Governments in the Council face two types of domestic constraints. One type can be labelled interest group pressure, and is distunguished by strong interest groups pushing an agenda at the EU level that is not necessarily in line with the preferences of the government. Lobbying has long been part of negotiations in Brussels. Lobbying typically display a pattern where national interests, organized in an umbrella organization, will go through their European counterpart to influence policy makers in Brussels. However often national umbrella organizations will also contact the relevant national ministers directly in order to convince them to push an agenda in the Council \citep{Beyers2002}. Most often interest groups will focus their attention on changing parts of the legislative text that they are not happy about, however when these efforts have proven futile the focus might be on recommending a government to vote no as a signal of support for domestic concerns. This has the effect of building relations between key constituent groups domestically, but will lower the standing of the government in the Council. The other constraint can be labelled public opinion. If a dossier at the EU level catches the eye of the public in a member state, it can have an impact in the re-election concerns of governments, particularly on EU sceptic member states such as the UK and Denmark. An interesting dynamic that has often been observed in the Council is blame shifting. In multilevel systems it is easy for institutions at at given level to engage in blame shifting and credit taking for political outcomes \citep{Anderson2006}. This has been observed in member states where governance is divided between different administrative structures, such as France and Germany \citep{Elgie2006}. It is no surprise that the same dynamic has also been oberserved to take place between member states governments and the EU \citep{Franchino2004}. If governments find themselves under pressure domestically, but are unable to block legislation at the EU level, it is tempting to vote no in order to appease the domestic audience, and blame the EU for forcing unwanted legislation. 

In the absence of domestic constraints, governments migh find themselves highly disagreeing with the outcome. The theory of diffuse reciprocity will predict that in these situation, the vote choice is dependent upon how much the future is weighted. If an actor has been very active in maintaining exchange relations then the future is weighted heavily, thus we would expect this actor to compromise. However actors that are not active in the system of exchanges will not weight the future very heavily, hence we will expect these actors to vote more along their preferences. This line of argument has been developed by \citet{HoylandHansen2010}. They argue that the consensus norm in the Council can be viewed as the propensity to override once own preferences in favor of a consensual decision. They are thus in line with the direct indicator approach specified in chapter \ref{chapter:theory}. In order to further specify this mechanism the authors use a spatial model with an added term to capture any effect of a consensus norm. Assuming that actors operate in a one-dimensional space with a linear loss function, the principle of utility maximization implies that an actor $i$ will vote yes to a dossier if:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  U_{ik}(-|x_{ik} - p_k|) < U_{ik}(-|x_{ik} - q_k|)
\end{equation}

Where $U_{ik}$ is the utility of actor $i$ on dossier $k$, $x_{ik}$ is the ideal position of actor $i$ on dossier $k$, $p_k$ is the position of the proposed dossier and $q_k$ is the status quo. Equation \ref{eq:1} thus represents the classic spatial model, to account for the effect of the consensus Hoyland \& Hansen add a third term, $\theta$, which is added in linear fashion to the loss function. Hence:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:2}
  U_{ik}(-|x_{ik} - p_k|) > U_{ik}(-|x_{ik} - q_k|) &= No \\
  U_{ik}(-|x_{ik} - p_k| + \theta_i) < U_{ik}(-|x_{ik} - q_k|) &= Yes
\end{align}

Theta, if positive, will have the effect of reversing the vote, whereas if set to zero or a negative value will have no effect. According to \citet{HoylandHansen2010} if theta is constant across actors this will be evidence of a norm, however the theory of diffuse reciprocity will expect that there is variation in theta, as it more accurately reflects the degree to which a given actor is embedded in an exchange system. The authors do indeed find that theta varies significantly across member states in the Council, this is interpreted as evidence against a consensus norm, although it fits with the theory of diffuse reciprocity. The modified spatial model presented by Hoyland \& Hansen helps to illuminate some of the dynamics that could explain the effect of the consensus norm. However, like the spatial models covered in chapter \ref{chapter:theory}, the approach can only explain the choice between voting yes or dissent. The model do not provide any clue as to why some governments will abstain or vote no on dossiers. What we can learn from the model is that in the presence of a positive theta, only a strong disagreement with the final outcome will result in a government choosing a dissenting vote. 

Based in the above considerations we can formulate the following hypotheses:

\begin{quote}
  H1: When there is domestic pressure governments will vote no on a given dossier
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  H2: When governments are preference outliers they will abstain on a given dossier
\end{quote}

The social environment is an important aspect of diffuse reciprocity. Only when actors meet and interact on a regular basis can we expect to see a norm of diffuse reciprocity develop. This is often referred to as a process of social learning. In its most simple form this process assumes what \citet{Skyrms1997} has called Markov agents, i.e. actors that only use the immediate past to adapt their behavior. Social learning in this context is defined by actors interacting and then updating their beliefs about other actors which might lead to a change in their behavior. If this process is run for a long enough period of time, then the interactions will settle on a specific pattern, and we say that the social system has converged. If we assume that actors memory stretches further back than just the immediate past we get actors that condition their future expectations on the past behaviors of their colleagues, which in small groups with a stable membership can lead to the emergence of diffuse reciprocity. The starting point of this causal chain is the interaction frequency, which is a key variable to account for. This opens up the possibility that a norm of diffuse reciprocity might be present to different degrees in different policy areas based on the meeting frequency of the Council configurations. In policy areas where the Council configuration only meet in-frequently we would expect the norm of diffuse reciprocity to be less strong than in policy areas where the Council configuration meet frequently. For instance in 2010 the General Affairs Council meet 16 times while the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECON) meet 29 times, hence we would expect that the norm of diffuse reciprocity is more present in the ECON configuration. In voting behavior this would manifest itself in fewer instances of governments voting yes to dossiers, but attaching dissenting statements to their votes. This leads to the following hypothesis:

\begin{quote}
  H3: The higher the meeting frequency the more often we will see governments attaching dissenting statements to yes votes
\end{quote}

\section{Research Design}

\subsection{Case Selection}

In order to test hypotheses about voting behavior in the Council it is important to have the proper universe of cases. In most studies of voting in the Council the focus has been on either the entire population of cases, typically aggregated in some fashion. This ignores the possibility that there might be a great number of dossiers in the Council that are mainly technical, and thus do not engender any deal of controversy from the member states government. In these non-controversial cases we should expect the Council to exhibit perfect cohesion with regards to voting. From our perspective these cases are also not interesting as only in cases with some degree of controversy do we expect the norm of diffuse reciprocity to be active. Hence it is important to be able to distinguish between cases in which the preferences of member states are all aligned, from cases in which there was some degree of disagreement within the Council. Indeed including these cases in the analysis risks biasing the analysis towards finding evidence for a high degree of consensus, and hence stack the deck in favor of a consensus reading of the Council. 

The first step in the analysis is to define the population of relevant cases. In our case the population is defined as dossiers treated in the Council where there was disagreement about the final outcome. In the literature on decision making in the EU several criteria has been used to separate controversial from uncontroversial dossiers. It has been common in the voting record literature to analyze cases on which there was a dissenting vote separately \citep{Heisenberg2005,Hayes-renshaw2006,Hagemann2008}. However this introduces selection bias if the dependent variable is the vote choice of the member states. The DEU project \citep{Thomson2006a} used the criteria of public reporting. If an act was mentioned in Agence Europe it was considered as being controversial. This approach has the drawback that it is not possible to discern whether this controversy represented divisions within the Council, or disagreements between constituent groups and the decision reached by the Council. In order to avoid this ambiguity I will use a more direct measure of controversy within the Council. The cases used in this paper are selected on the basis of having, at one point, been treated as a B-point in the Council.

The Council agenda distinguishes between A and B points, where A points are dossiers that do not require discussion at the ministerial level, and B points are dossiers in which no agreement could be reached on working group level and need discussion at ministerial level. It is common practice in the Council that issues that are discussed as B points are afterwards send back to the COREPER for a final drafting and than at a later date adopted as an A point in the Council. In recent years several scholars have noted the presence of ``false B-points'' \citep{Lewis1998,hage2008,Muehlbock2011}. These are dossiers where agreement has already been reached at a lower level, but are discussed at the ministerial level to allow a minister to make an oral statement. These statements can be used to voice reservations against the dossier, or might be intended for a domestic constituency. Hence from the point of this chapter ``false B-points'' do not represent a problematic category. The same authors also mention the presence of ``false A-points''. These are cases where a dossier is adopted as an A-point, but was at some stage discussed as a B-point in the Council. This implies that if we only focus on dossiers that were adopted as B-points we would miss a great number of controversial cases. To account for this the selection rule developed above selects cases that at any point during their treatment in the Council was discussed as B-points in the Council. 

The advantage of selecting only cases treated as B-points in the Council is that we are sure to select cases in which there were some controversy related to differences within the Council, and the selection rule does not restrict the variance on the voting outcome. This make it possible to mitigate any potential bias by including non-relevant cases. 

A word on the unit of analysis is warranted here. Most studies of the Council have the member state as the unit of analysis, this obviously leads to conclusions on the member state level as well. In some instances where we can expect the preferences of member states to be constant despite changing governments, this is an appropriate unit of analysis, however if we can expect the behavior of delegations in the Council to change as the parties in office change then the assumption is problematic. The natural unit of analysis in the Council is the present government in office, this implies that besides having variation between member states, we can also expect to observe variation within the individual member state as governments change. Ignoring this variation can have quite dramatic effects. To see how this can effect the analysis of voting behavior in the Council consider Sweden. During the third installment of the social democratic Persson government, Sweden had 28 dissenting votes, thus placing the Persson III government among the most dissenting governments in the 1999 - 2009 period. Compare this to the successor government, the liberal Rheinfeldt government, that only registered a dissenting vote 8 times. The Persson III government was in power for 1446 days, and the Rheinfeldt I government for 1460 days, hence the difference is unlikely to be caused by a sudden bias in the Commission proposals. However the governments differed significantly in how much they deviated from Council median left-right position. The Persson III government had a deviation of 2.27, whereas the Rheinfeldt government only had a deviation of 1.24. Hence the difference in the dissenting behavior can most likely be attributed to ideological differences with the other member states governments. If we were to ignore this and simply lump both governments together as being Sweden, then we would wrongly classify sweden as being a middle of the road member state, while ignoring the great differences in Swedish governments behavior in the Council. Thus the natural unit of analysis when trying to explain Council voting behavior are the governments of memberstates. 


\subsection{Data and Variables}
The dataset used in this paper cover the years 1999 to 2009 and includes every vote in the Council during this time period. In total there are votes registered on 3937 dossiers, which gives a total of 78968 votes cast by member states governments. Of these 16473 where cast for dossiers that at one point was a B point in the Council. Beside the vote cast, the data also contains information on whether a statement was registered by any member state, and whether this statement expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome. This coding is more fine grained compared to most studies who either ignore the possibility of registering a statement in conjunction with a vote, or simply code whether there was a formal statement or not.

The focus of this study is the voting behavior of the member states in the Council of the EU. As such the dependent variable is the individual vote choice of the government in power in a given member state. There are three vote choices available to any member state, namely yes, no or abstain. These choices are coupled with the possibility of also registering a statement in conjunction with the vote. Since the theoritical interest is centered around yes votes with a negative statement, the votes have been split into four categories:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Yes
\item No
\item Abstain
\item Yes + Statement
\end{enumerate}

Here we have only included the statements that express dissatisfaction with the final outcome. Thus the dependent variable reflect one category of agreement (yes) and five categories of different types of dissent. It is difficult to rank vote choices, they represent different choices which do not have a well defined high and low point according to which they can be ranked. For this reason the variable is treated as being nominal in this paper. 

The independent variables are measured on two levels, namely the dossier level and the member state government level. The member state government is the lowest level in the data, and are nested with the dossier level, such that for each dossier we have recorded between 15 and 27 votes that are attributed to governments from the member states. Table \ref{tab:variables} show the variables along with the source and descriptive statistics. 




\section{Descriptive Evidence}
As a first look at the data table \ref{fig:depvar} show the distribution of votes across Council Configurations. The number of yes votes, have been left out as they dominates the distribution. Even after having selected only definitive legal acts that where treated as B points in the Council, the number of yes votes is staggering. The second largest category is abstentions. The third largest category, in most Council is a yes vote with a dissenting statement attached. This show that studies not taking Council statements into account risk biasing their findings towards consent. The prevalence of attaching negative statements to supporting votes suggests that there is a large degree of signaling behavior going on in the Council. It is important to let your colleagues know that you are a team player and willing to compromise. This speaks for the interpretation of negotiations in the Council as oriented towards diffuse reciprocity. It is also striking that dissenting behavior is not equally distributed across Council configurations. Agriculture\& Fisheries, Competition and Employment, Health \& Consumer Affairs exhibit a very high degree of dissent when compared to the other Council configurations. Thus we clearly see some policy specific effects on voting.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\scalebox{.6}{\input{VoteChoice_Chapter/Figures/depvar}}
\caption{}
\label{fig:depvar}
\end{figure}

In order to gauge the possible effect of the posited explanatory variables it is useful to tabulate them against the dependent variable. In figure \ref{fig:scatter} the government distance to the mean government position in the Council has been plotted against the number of abstentions, no votes and yes votes with dissenting statements for each government. The plot is conditioned on whether a government is from an old or new member states, and for each category a regression line has been overlaid. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\scalebox{.6}{\subfloat[][]{\input{VoteChoice_Chapter/Figures/scatter1}}}\quad

\caption{The plot show the degree of deviance from the mean left-right position in the Council on the x-axis, and the number of abstentions on the y-axis. The values have been conditioned on whether a government was from an old or new member state.}
\label{fig:scatter}
\end{figure}

Consistently across all categories we see a positive relationship between deviance and the number of dissenting votes for old member states, and the opposite, although very weak, relationship for new member states. The plots show a somewhat surprising result as most of the literature on the Council show that there was no large effect of the eastern enlargement, but there does seem to be quite a large difference in voting behavior between governments from new and old member states. Hypothesis two is partly supported by Figure \ref{fig:scatter}, but only for old member states. New member states do not engage in dissenting behavior to the same extent as old member states, the modus operandi seem to be supportive of the outcome of Council negotiations, regardless of how much the deviate from the Council mean left-right position. Panel (b) in Figure \ref{fig:scatter} is not entirely expected, as the theory of diffuse reciprocity do not link no votes to being an outlier within in the Council, they are supposed to signal back home, despite that a government might be in favor of a dossier. One should be careful in interpreting the figures, though, as we cannot know how many cases there were an overlap of an outlying government that was also under domestic pressure to resist the result of the Council negotiations. We also see that yes votes with a dissenting statement increase as a government becomes more of an outlier in the Council, this is also what we would expect as in these instances the norm of diffuse reciprocity should be effective.  

The examine hypothesis three initially presents some obstacles. To avoid the effect of time, i.e. the longer a government has been in the Council the more likely it is to have cast a dissenting vote, the number of votes in a given choice category relative to the time spend in the Council were plotted, conditioned on the time spend in the council. The y-axis show the density within each category, while the x-axis show the relative voting frequency.

\caption{The plots show the conditional distribtion of relative voting frequencies within each time category.}
\label{fig:histogram}
\end{figure}

The important aspect to notice in Figure \ref{fig:histogram} is that for the no votes, conditioning on meeting frequency does not change the distribution in any significant way. The choice to cast a no vote is independent of the time spend in the Council. This corroborates the thesis that no votes are signaling devices aimed at domestic audiences, as the interest of domestic audiences in the dossiers coming from the Commission are independent of time. For abstentions and yes votes with a dissenting statement we see that the number of governments that has not cast a vote in this category decrease as time passes, lending partial corroborating evidence for hypothesis three.




\section{Inferential Analysis}
In order to further test the hypotheses we turn to statistical modeling. The dependent variable is the vote choice of the individual government, since it is difficult to rank the variable a multinomial logisitc choice model is appropriate. These models are suitable first and foremost as they do not make any assumptions about the ordinality of a variable, furthermore they do not make any assumption about normality, linearity and homogeneity of variance of the independent variables. Thus these models represent a very flexible modeling framework when dealing with choice categories. However there are two crucial assumptions made in these models which must be justified. The first assumption is commonly labelled independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). This assumes that the results from the analysis would not change if we threw in another choice category which would clearly be irrelevant to the problem being modeled. The classic example is the study of modes of transport. If subjects has to make a choice between taking the bus, ride a bike or taking the car to work, then the results from such an analysis should not change if we added two bus categories, one with red busses and one with blue busses. Since the color coding of busses should be irrelevant we would expect the subjects to randomly choose between the two busses. 


The overall pattern that emerges from the models is one where receiving more from the EU than you give, and being powerful reduces dissenting behavior, whereas being a preference outlier decreases the number of yes votes, however the number of yes votes with a dissenting statement increases substantially. The first two effects can be explained by classic rational-institutionalist mechanisms, however the last effect is not so straightforward. From a rational-institutionalist perspective sending conflicting signals (voting yes, but saying no) is meaningful in signaling games where the players are trying to outsmart each other. In the present context the statement is attached after the vote, so it could not have been part of a bargaining strategy. From a logrolling perspective the behavior is also puzzling. There is no reason for an actor after a deal has been done, to then publicly state his/her opposition to this deal while still supporting it. From a logrolling perspective, once a deal has been done its done \citep{Warntjen2010}. From the perspective of diffuse reciprocity, such behavior makes more sense. Signaling do not necessarily have to be towards a well defined opponent, as the rational choice signaling games assume, but could also be aimed at future negotiations with the same partners. This notion of signaling to a future, unknown, negotiation, is only possible when a level of trust and reciprocity has been created in a group. This has been amply documented to be the case in the Council. Furthermore \citet{ElgstromJonsson2000} has shown that this type of behavior is consistent with a problem-solving style of bargaining, where there is a long shadow of the future. Hence the results reported here provide further support for the statement by Elgstrom and Jonnson, that the council is made up of:

\begin{quote}
  ``[...] a predominant problem-solving approavh with islands of conflictual bargaining.
\flushright{- \citealt[p. 697]{ElgstromJonsson2000}}
\end{quote}

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper a new data set was used which merged data from the PreLex data base and the Council monthly summaries. This allowed us to select cases that all had an element of conflict in them, based on the fact that non-controversial dossiers do not contain any meaningful information when studying decision making in the Council. The data was then disaggregated into each vote for each government in each member state of the EU. This allowed the use of a multinomial logit model to model the vote choice of the individual government. The implication being that studies who only focuses on member states risk biasing their analysis as governments change. That different governments from the same member state can differ a lot was witnessed in table \ref{tab:dissent}, where the Schroeder II government was among the ten most dissenting government in the EU in the 1999 - 2009 period, wheres the Merkel governments did not come close to the top. The explanation lies in the fact that the preference composition of the Council changes over time as old governments leave office and new governments enter office. Thus the Schroeder II government found itself an outlier in the Council (an average absolute deviation of 2.46 over its duration). The effect of being an outlier does not only lead to an increase in no votes and abstentions, but also to a substantial increase in dissenting statements attached to yes votes. An increase that is much more pronounced than the increase in no votes and abstentions. This type of behavior is difficult to reconcile with either a pure rational-institutionalist argument or a pure constructivist argument. In stead the answer is complex and lies between the two poles. Governments engage in both bargaining and problem-solving, however from af frequency point of view problem-solving is dominant. The fact that the main variable supposed to capture the effect of socialization did not show any effect, whereas the classic rational-institutionalist variables where significant, but had effects that where not predicted by the theory provides several points worthy of mentioning. First of all, the proxy for socialization was most likely a bad proxy, so it can be argued whether this paper successfully managed to find the pure rational-institutionalist effect of the outlier variable. This would explain the differentiated effects of the outlier variable. This, however, raises another point. Since a large part of the effect of the outlier variable was in an area of the dependent variable not measured in other studies, papers only using classic rational-institutionalist variables , without controlling for socialization effects, risks introducing bias into their models.
